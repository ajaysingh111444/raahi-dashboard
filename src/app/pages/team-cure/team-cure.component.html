                A person who adds a new definition to anything he touches. Some people know him as an Entrepreneur; some know him as a poet, for some he is a game changer, for others he is a man of hope. A man who keeps his profile low as according to him "I am just doing my work", Surya Pratap Singh is the founder of <strong>Humanity Welfare Council</strong>  and has set up many business verticals. The main reason to admire him is that he donates whatever he earns. After working a lot and with many organizations he somewhere realized that the condition of his country can't become better unless a very transparent organization is formed with a hard working and dedicated team. He then took a decision to form an organization on which people can rely and which will deliver results on ground level and not just paper work. So, <strong>Humanity Welfare Council</strong> came into existence on 8th Nov 2017. After a lot of hard work and a lot of research, projects were designed. These projects were based on the needs of the common people, needs which if unfulfilled were the biggest obstruction in the development of the nation.
