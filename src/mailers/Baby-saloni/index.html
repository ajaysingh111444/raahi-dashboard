                    Everyone says to take care of her as she may not survive, some even tell she is an avatar as we have never seen someone's head like this. We don't know what has happened to her, but we want her with us as she is our first child - says Sanjay, father of Baby Saloni

                    Baby Saloni was born on 19th Nov 2020 to Sanjay and Manisha in a village in Uttar Pradesh. Sanjay is labour working at construction sites and Manisha is a homemaker. The couple when they learnt that they will be having a baby as this was something good happening in their life for the first time since they got married. Sanjay and Manisha got married at a very young age and their financial condition is extremely poor.

                    Sanjay is trying all possible ways but all in vain, Sanjay's known sources also belong to the same profile of work and are hardly able to earn enough to survive. The situation is so depressing that it's too hard to express in words. The lockdown has also played its role well resulting in a complete financial breakdown for the family.

                    Since her birth, I am struggling for her as we had nothing to survive on during the lockdown and her condition has completely ripped me off from inside. I don't want to lose her and even can't see her in so much pain. Her condition is becoming critical day by day and we don't have enough to feed her also. Sometimes very bad thoughts come in my mind but I believe that God will make everything good for her and us also - says Sanjay

                    The couple is not much educated and Sanjay is the only earning hand in the family. Sanjay hardly earns between Rs 200 - Rs 400 per day depending on the availability of the work and have no parental property. They have already taken a lot of debts to survive the crisis due to COVID-19 and then baby Saloni's birth and current medical treatment.

                    Manisha says -"I know what it feels like to be uneducated, my parents were very poor and couldn't send me to school. I wanted to study, but I will make sure our daughter gets a good education and she will become a doctor and will treat poor people for free. We will work hard and will make sure that she gets what we couldn't, we will give her a better life and a better future"
