                    Divyansh is four years old and has been dealing with a serious medical condition for the past three months. He feels excessive pain while passing urine. He is unable to understand the problem as he is too young to deal with such pain. He feels reluctant to share his problem with his friends and family. Doctors suggest an immediate operation to save his life.

                    Divyansh's mother is too young and hardly makes both ends meet by working as a housemaid. She does housework in multiple houses and gathers food from them in the evening. His father has no permanent job and is missing for the last eight days. He could not bear the excessive financial burden and left his family all alone to deal with the agony. His younger sister is just one and a half years old and cries for her mother’s attention. With no funds and support, Divyansh's mother is wandering on the streets in search of her husband and food. She finds no support and returns hopeless every evening. She already owes a lot of money to her owners and can’t ask for more. And as time passes Divyansh's condition is getting worse. We are her only hope to save her child and give relief to their family from this financial burden.

                    “I can’t play. I feel excessive burning and pain while urinating. People say I will get better with time but it’s getting worse with every passing day. In fear of pain, I don’t drink or eat. I miss my father, my friends make fun of me that my father left us. I want to live a normal life and eat and drink like other children. Please save me from this suffering.” A little Divyansh crying and explaining his pain.
