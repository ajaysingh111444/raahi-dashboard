                    Due to his medical condition, Kamlesh recently lost both of his legs and is now alone seeking support to survive.

Kamlesh is alone as he is bed-ridden from the past 22 yrs. He has no one to look of support except his younger brother Deva who takes care of Kamlesh although he is not able to earn enough to support his own family.

                    Kamlesh had pressure sores due to his bed-ridden condition and was really in a very pathetic condition when he was admitted to hospital.

                    Doctors said - "He was in too much pain when he was brought to hospital, his condition was very pathetic. You can't even see his photographs that we took for medical records. Kamlesh is in real need of support as they don't have enough to feed. I myself have supported him as he has no one to look after. His younger brother is not earning nowadays"

                    We can just imagine the condition of Deva, the younger brother of Kamlesh who works as a helper and is hardly able to earn between Rs 300 - Rs 350 on a daily basis depending on the work availability with the contractor under which he works.

                    Deva is having a wife and no children. His wife is not so cooperative but still Deva tries to manage the situation. Currently due to the pandemic situation, Deva has no job and he is heavily debt-ridden due to the medical expenses of Kamlesh.

                    Deva says with tears in his eyes - "I am trying everything I can to support my brother, but it is becoming very hard for me to meet the requirements. I am myself sleeping empty stomach due to no food, how can I feed my brother and wife."

                    Kamlesh is not getting proper food and medicine due to which he has already lost 40 kg weight. Life can be tough sometimes and it can make someone so needy as in the case of Kamlesh.
